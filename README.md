## Project Goal
For our semester project, we decided to take a look into the world of sleep! We are trying to find correlations between how different factors contribute to the quality of sleep people experience.
Our goal is to find the factors that greatly contribute to the greatest amount and quality of sleep so everyone can enjoy a good night's rest.

## Introduction

## Technology Used
- [R Language](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
- [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

## Datasets
We used the following datasets that can be found on Kaggle:

- [Sleep Efficiency](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equilibriumm/sleep-efficiency)
- [Sleep Health and Lifestyle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

## Findings

###  Caffeine Consumption
**Does Caffeine Affect Sleep?**
In graph [1], we can see that although the majority of respondent does not drink coffee or any caffeine at all. People at age 25 - 40 drank 25mg to 75mg 24 hours prior to bed time. Lets see if caffeine consumption affect sleep efficiency

Although caffeine consumption is believed to worsen sleep quality, our dataset shows differently. In graph [], the median of sleep efficiency decreased slightly from 0.82 to 0.80 at 0mg to 50mg caffeine consumption. At 75 to 200mg caffeine consumption, the median of sleep efficiency goes up to 0.8 - 0.9. However, as shown in graph [1], the data for caffeine consumption above 100 mg is relatively small, so it's difficult to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between caffeine consumption and sleep efficiency at these higher levels.
Therefore, given the limitations of the data, it is not possible to say definitively whether caffeine consumption has a positive or negative impact on sleep efficiency. 

### Alcohol Consumption
**Does Alcohol Affect Sleep?**


The graph [] shows that the sleep efficiency decreases as alcohol increases. The median sleep efficiency is 0.86 for people who consume 0 drinks per day, but it decreases to 0.82 for people who consume 1 drink. The median decreases to 0.65 to 0.76 for people who consume more than 2 drinks. This suggests that drinking alcohol, even in moderate amounts, can disrupt sleep.
